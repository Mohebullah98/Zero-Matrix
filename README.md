# Zero-Matrix
An optimal algorithm that sets the entire corresponding row and column of an element that is = 0 all to 0.

Problem Description: If an element in a mxn matrix is zero, it's entire row and column should be set to 0.

The best case run time for this algorithm is O(n^2) because we need to run through the entire matrix atleast once to check for 0s.
We have achieved O(n^2) runtime and O(1) space because we don't require any additional matrix to do our operation.
